# Tile Manipulation Button Fix

This document describes the fix for the tile manipulation button system that was preventing users from painting new textures on existing hexes.

## Problem Description

### Original Issue
- Tile manipulation buttons (cycle, rotate left, rotate right) covered most of the hex area
- When a hex had terrain, clicking anywhere on the hex would trigger tile manipulation instead of allowing new texture painting
- Users couldn't easily replace existing textures with new ones
- The button regions were too large (80% of hex radius, divided into thirds)

### User Impact
- **Frustrating workflow**: Users couldn't paint new textures over existing ones
- **Limited functionality**: Tile manipulation took precedence over basic painting
- **Poor UX**: No clear visual indication of where buttons vs. painting areas were

## Solution Overview

### 1. **Smaller Button Regions**
- **Before**: Button regions covered 80% of hex radius in three equal zones
- **After**: Button regions limited to 50% of hex radius with focused areas
- **Result**: Much more space available for normal painting around the edges

### 2. **Smart Interaction Logic**
- **Condition**: Tile manipulation only triggers when NO texture is selected in paint menu
- **Behavior**: When user has a texture selected, clicking anywhere paints the new texture
- **Fallback**: When no texture selected, button regions work for tile manipulation

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- Buttons only appear when no texture is selected
- Clear indication of when tile manipulation vs. painting mode is active
- Reduced visual clutter when user wants to paint

## Technical Implementation

### Button Region Detection Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
// Covered 80% of hex, divided into thirds
if (distance > hexRadius * 0.8) return null;
const hexWidth = hexRadius * 1.5;
const zoneWidth = hexWidth / 3;
if (deltaX < -zoneWidth / 2) return 'left';
if (deltaX > zoneWidth / 2) return 'right';
return 'center';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only covers 50% of hex, with focused button areas
if (distance > hexRadius * 0.5) return null;
const buttonSize = hexRadius * 0.25;

// Specific button zones with gaps between them
if (deltaX < -buttonSize && Math.abs(deltaY) < buttonSize) return 'left';
if (deltaX > buttonSize && Math.abs(deltaY) < buttonSize) return 'right';
if (Math.abs(deltaX) < buttonSize && Math.abs(deltaY) < buttonSize) return 'center';
return null; // Everything else allows painting
```

### Interaction Logic Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
// Always prioritized tile manipulation if button region detected
if (menuOpen && tileHoverState.buttonRegion && selectedIcon?.name !== 'eraser') {
  // Tile manipulation triggered
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only allow tile manipulation when no texture is selected
if (menuOpen && tileHoverState.buttonRegion && 
    selectedIcon?.name !== 'eraser' && !selectedTexture) {
  // Tile manipulation triggered only if no new texture to paint
}
```

### Component Updates

1. **HexGrid.tsx**: Added `selectedTexture` prop
2. **HexGridApp.tsx**: Pass `selectedTexture` to HexGrid
3. **Button rendering**: Only show buttons when no texture selected

## User Experience Improvements

### Clear Interaction Modes

**Texture Painting Mode** (when texture selected):
- ✅ Click anywhere on hex to paint new texture
- ✅ Large clickable area for easy painting
- ✅ No button interference
- ✅ Intuitive behavior

**Tile Manipulation Mode** (when no texture selected):
- ✅ Focused button areas for precise control
- ✅ Clear visual feedback with button overlays
- ✅ Cycle and rotate functions work normally
- ✅ Still allows painting in blank areas

### Workflow Benefits

1. **Streamlined Texture Replacement**:
   - Select new texture → Click on existing hex → Texture replaced
   - No need to erase first or navigate around buttons

2. **Preserved Tile Manipulation**:
   - Deselect texture → Hover over textured hex → Use manipulation buttons
   - All existing functionality remains available

3. **Intuitive Behavior**:
   - Paint menu selection clearly indicates intent
   - Visual feedback matches interaction mode
   - Reduced cognitive load for users

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Basic Texture Replacement**
**Steps:**
1. Place terrain on hex
2. Select different terrain type
3. Click on existing hex

**Expected:** New texture replaces old texture

### 2. **Tile Manipulation Access**
**Steps:**
1. Place terrain on hex
2. Deselect all textures (click elsewhere in menu)
3. Hover over textured hex

**Expected:** Manipulation buttons appear and work

### 3. **Edge Area Painting**
**Steps:**
1. Place terrain on hex
2. Select new texture
3. Click near edge of hex

**Expected:** New texture painted (no button interference)

### 4. **Mixed Usage**
**Steps:**
1. Use tile manipulation on some hexes
2. Select texture and repaint other hexes
3. Switch between modes

**Expected:** Both modes work smoothly without conflicts

## Accessibility Improvements

- **Larger clickable areas** for painting (50% more space)
- **Clear mode indication** through visual feedback
- **Predictable behavior** based on menu selection
- **Reduced precision requirements** for common painting tasks

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Visual button size indicators** to show exact clickable areas
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for tile manipulation
- **Configurable button sensitivity** in settings
- **Touch-friendly button sizing** for mobile devices

### Advanced Features
- **Context-sensitive buttons** that adapt to terrain type
- **Gesture-based manipulation** (swipe to rotate, double-tap to cycle)
- **Batch manipulation tools** for multiple hexes
- **Undo support** for tile manipulation actions
